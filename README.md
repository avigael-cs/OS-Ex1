# OS - EX1 -  compiler, shared libraries and processes.

###  Part A – compilation and libraries:

Intro: when we write a “normal” C application, we have all the source code files. We compile and link them to a single executable file.

We can also compile our code to a library that can be included to other projects statically or dynamically.

In this task we are requested to produce a simple C executable, and a shared library that can be used by this executable. You are also requested to provide a Make file, that will help to utilize each of the sub tasks.

Subtask 1 - 1.1 - In this question we were required to write a simple program called "hello_ariel" and write a main function that would run the program "hello_ariel".

Subtask 2 -  2.1 -  compile “hello_ariel” as a shared object (.so) library 2.2 write a short main “main1_2” that will use this library 2.3 compile to a single executable and update the make file.

Subtask 3 -  3.1 -  In this question we were asked to write a main that used the library from subtask 2 at runtime.

Subtask 4  -  4.1  - practice with tools (which functions exist, which libs are used) 4.2 alter the make file to have default build, and clean options


###   Part B - Processes:

You are requested to implement a aunching app, that will start a few processes.

Subtask 1 -  Start 2 processes as nested childs of the main app.

Subtask 2 -  Start 2 processes with the same shared memory.

Subtask 3 -  Start a daemon process.

Subtask 4  - Modify your app, to have all the above subtasks together. Show the relevant processes tree  (pstree) that will reflect the tasks result.
